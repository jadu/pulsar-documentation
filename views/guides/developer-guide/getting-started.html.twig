    <p class="lede">As a Jadu designer or developer, you’re probably working on one or more of the Jadu platform products (CMS, XFP and CXM). Pulsar is already installed and available for you to use in your user-interface. There are, however, some important things to know.</p>

    {{ docs.heading('h2', 'The basics') }}
    {{ docs.heading('h3', 'The Pulsar team') }}

    <p>There are two full—time Pulsar team members, Paul and James.</p>

    <p>
        <div class="github-card" data-user="stanton"></div>
        <div class="github-card" data-user="jamesjacobs"></div>
        <script src="https://lab.lepture.com/github-cards/widget.js"></script>
    </p>

    <p>There are <a href="https://github.com/jadu/pulsar/graphs/contributors">many more people</a> at Jadu who contribute (or <em>have</em> contributed) to Pulsar, usually in the context of implementing user interfaces and creating pull requests to fix bugs or achieve specific things. Any and all contributions are welcomed with open arms. The Pulsar design system is open-source under the MIT license, we don't have a separate agile structure and the bulk of Pulsar work is directly in response to the demands of Jadu product teams.</p>

    {{ docs.heading('h3', 'Getting help') }}

    <p>The #pulsar Jadu slack channel is the main place to ask for assistance.</p>

    {{ docs.heading('h3', 'Bug reports and feature requests') }}

    <p>For issues directly related to Pulsar, you can <a href="https://github.com/jadu/pulsar/issues/new?template=bug_report.md">create a bug report</a> or a <a href="https://github.com/jadu/pulsar/issues/new?template=feature_request.md">new feature request</a> on GitHub, you will need a GitHub account to do so.</p>

    <p>However, when you're working within a Jadu product and you find a user-interface related bug there's a good chance you may actually want to create a product bug ticket using that team's bug reporting process (usually in Jira), your Product Owner or a Pulsar team member should be able to help you decide where an issue needs reporting. Don't be afraid of creating GitHub tickets by mistake, we'll be happy to help you move them to the right place if needs be.</p>

    <p>So you have to build a user interface in a Jadu product, well there's a few things we should cover first.</p>

    {{ docs.heading('h3', 'How to update the Pulsar version used in a product') }}

    <p>The Pulsar team releases frequent updates to the design system and publish the <a href="https://github.com/jadu/pulsar/releases">release notes</a> on GitHub. Each product team has their own internal process on how to request a Pulsar update as this will typically involve a risk analysis and testing plan to identify areas of the software which will need extra testing because of the expected changes in a given release.</p>
